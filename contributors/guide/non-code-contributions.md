  Looking for a good entrance into the project? or to do something different?
  There are many ways to contribute to the Kubernetes project without having
  to have coding experience: issue triage, writing documentation, joining the
  release team and much more.
---

*This section is new and in progress. Expect this document to change often.*

*If you are interested in helping define and structure this work, [check the weekly meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gdFWfkrapQclZ4-z4Lx2JwqKsJjXXUOVoLhBzZiZgSk/edit#) for information on how to get involved. You can also find us in the SIG Contributor Experience [Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-contribex).*

*All contributors welcome, new and old!*

### What is this?

The list below is meant to help non-code contributors find areas of the Kubernetes project where their expertise can be best utilized. The goal of this is to both provide a starting guide for anyone looking to become a contributor not necessarily writing code, and also to fill any needs that the SIGs have that might not currently be filled by code-focused contributors.

This list is meant to be used by both new contributors looking for a good entrance into the project, and current contributors who would like to do something different.
